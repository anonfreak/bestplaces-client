# BestPlaces
Track your favorite Places and find more of them.
## Structure
Because of our Server-Client-Structure, we decided to use two different repositories to devide server and client, which both are written in different languages. You are able to access our server-repository [here](http://github.com/anonfreak/bestplaces-server).
## Idea
Our demo-client, which we will develop in first place, will be written in Java. By using Vaadin we're able to provide a beautiful web-service for BestPlaces. Vaadin will run on an Apache Tomcat Server, which is accessable from the internet. A link will be provided soon.
